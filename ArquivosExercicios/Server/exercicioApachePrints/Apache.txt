Erro pcre

Primeiro instalei o pcre em /usr/local/pcre, usando

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/pcre
make
Sudo make install

Try using apt-cache search, e.g.,

apt-cache search pcre
For me this turns up a lot so I grep for the keyword dev.

This turns up libpcre3-dev and libpcre++-dev.

lighttpd will use one of those no doubt.

So if your search shows libpcre3-dev, you can install using:
sudo apt install libpcre3-dev


Eu o resolvi dando o caminho na configuração do Apache

./configure \
--with-included-apr \
--with-pcre=/usr/local/pcre/bin/pcre-config 



Expat
Download expat-2.2.6.tar.bz2 from https://libexpat.github.io/.

Extract expat using following command

tar xvjf expat-2.2.6.tar.bz2 -C /path-to-dir

Change to the extracted expat directory.

Build expat using following commands

./configure --prefix=/path-to-expat-installation-dir

make

make install

While building Apache Httpd from source specify --with-expat

./configure --with-included-apr --prefix=/path-to-apache-installation --with-expat=/path-to-expat-installation-dir
